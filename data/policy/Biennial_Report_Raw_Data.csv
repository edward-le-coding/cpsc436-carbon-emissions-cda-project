A new series of landfill gas assessments took place in 2016 with the same requirement being required for 2021. Reduction estimates are based on modelling of likely impact of the regulatory approach, allowing for variances in the performance of the technologic solutions applied to meet the standard. CleanBC commits the province to helping communities achieve 95% organic waste diversion, including systems in place to capture 75% of landfill gas. The province will also pursue efforts to make better use of waste, including bioenergy and biofuels."
