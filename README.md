## Description
Our project focuses on exploring the annual trends of Canadaâ€™s carbon emissions over time. Our goal is to provide users (i.e. the Canadian public) with the knowledge to understand where Canada has been and where Canada wants to go in reducing carbon emissions and creating a healthier low-carbon future. We provide two main visualizations to allow users to see historical and projected future emissions.

## File Structure Description
The code is structured along two paths, representing our two visualizations (`historical` and `policy`).
Each visualization will have its own `main.js` controlling their behvaviours).

Data is stored in the data folder (along `historical` and `policy` lines).
The javascript files follow a similar correspondence between `historical` and `policy`.

The historical visualization is composed of a heatmap (`heatmap.js`), a choropleth (`choropleth.js`),
and a stacked bar chart (`stackedBarChart.js`). There are coordinated interactions between all three plots.

The policy visualization is composed of a stacked bachart (`timeline.js`)
