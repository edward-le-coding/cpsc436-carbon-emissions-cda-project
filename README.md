The following is to indicate what is still work in progress.
TODOs for final submission:
- fix layout
- fix the css labels in regard to stacked bar chart (are too general at the moment, need to refer to stacked bar chart more clearly)
- fix the heatmap not indicating what sturation of colors mean
- make stacked bar chart and choropleth transition in like heatmap as well
- ensure website is more or less responsive (currently margins hardcoded as pixels instead of vH)
- fix temporary fix of position: sticky
- hook up choropleth and heatmap to waypoints steps
